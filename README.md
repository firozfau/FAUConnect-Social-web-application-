## Getting Started

The web application development roadmap focuses on creating a sensitive individual-based platform where users can securely store personal information and documents for various purposes. While it shares some similarities with a dating application, it is not solely a dating platform. This application strictly limits access to individuals within a specific University (FAU), with its primary goal being knowledge sharing among its members.


in details:
FauConnect is a Professional social web application designed specifically for FAU staff. Users can communicate with each other by verifying their identity through their IDM IDs via the FAU server. The platform operates as a one-to-one connection platform with two modes: Inspiration Mode and Focus Mode. Additionally, FauConnect includes data analysis features, offering psychological analysis and visualizations of user activity reports.
The goal of this project is to develop an easy-to-use application that allows FAU employees to either be set up randomly with another FAU member or to find partners in a specific thematic area or for research collaborations.

Users of the application create an account, in which they enter their personal (full name, email address, gender, picture, spoken languages: German and/or English) and FAU-related information (status group: scientific staff/non-scientific staff; organizational unit, research areas/areas of expertise). Every participant can select 3 current key topics they would like to have an exchange about (e.g. “study program development”, “Campo”, “machine learning” etc.) Participants will only be matched with people who speak at least one of their selected languages. The matchmaking is carried out by the application without the involvement of the participants, i.e. participants cannot browse through the existing profiles, but are set up with a “match” by the app (according to their settings).

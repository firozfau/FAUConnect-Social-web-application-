## Getting Started

The web application development roadmap focuses on creating a sensitive individual-based platform where users can securely store personal information and documents for various purposes. While it shares some similarities with a dating application, it is not solely a dating platform. This application strictly limits access to individuals within a specific University (FAU), with its primary goal being knowledge sharing among its members.
